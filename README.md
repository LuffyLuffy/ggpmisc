Package '__ggpmisc__' (Miscellaneous Extensions to 'ggplot2') is a set of extensions to R package 'ggplot2' (>= 2.1.0) useful when plotting diverse types of data.  Currently available statistics, geoms and function add facilities for labeling
peaks and valleys, generating labels for fitted models including polynomial
equations, highlighting deviations from a model fit and for debugging new geoms
and statistics (or learning how they work). Plottng of time series data is
facilitated by a 'fortify-like' function.

Documentation generated with package 'staticdocs' is available on-line. 

Please, see the web site [r4photobiology](http://www.r4photobiology.info) for 
details and update notices. Other packages, aimed at easing photobiology-related
calculations including the quantification of biologically effective radiation
in meteorology are available as part of a suite described at the same
website.

The current release of '__ggpmisc__' is available through [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggpmisc) 
for R (>= 3.2.0).
