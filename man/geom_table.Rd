\usage{
geom_table(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", ..., parse = FALSE, check_overlap = FALSE,
  na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}} or \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes_}}. Only needs
to be set at the layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
the plot defaults.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer,
as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of a
call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}}. This
can include aesthetics whose values you want to set, not map. See
\code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}} for more details.}

\item{parse}{If TRUE, the labels will be parsed into expressions and
displayed as described in ?plotmath.}

\item{check_overlap}{If \code{TRUE}, text that overlaps previous text in the
same layer will not be plotted.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), removes missing values with a
warning.  If \code{TRUE} silently removes missing values.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE}
never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather
than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that
define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the
default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2]{borders}}.}
}
\description{
\code{geom_table} adds a textual table directly to the ggplot using syntax
similar to that of \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_label}}.
}
\details{
Note the "width" and "height" like of a text element are 0, so stacking
and dodging tables will not work by default, and axis limits are not
automatically expanded to include all tables. Obviously, tables do have
height and width, but they are physical units, not data units. The amount of
space they occupy on that plot is not constant in data units: when you resize
a plot, tables stay the same size, but the size of the axes changes.
}
\note{
This geom works only with tibbles as \code{data}, as it expects a list
  of data frames or a list of tibbles to be mapped to the \code{label}
  aesthetic. In the current version the following aesthetics affect the text
  within the table \code{size}, \code{colour}, and \code{alpha}. The argument
  to parameter \code{parse} is simply passed forward to
  \code{gridExtra::ttheme_default()}. As \code{x} and \code{y} determine the
  position of the whole table, similarly to that of a text label,
  justification is interpreted as indicating the position of the table with
  respect to the $x$ and $y$ coordinates in the data, and \code{angle} is
  used to rotate the table as a whole. Other aesthetics, including
  \code{fill} are not yet implemented, neither are themes for table
  formatting. \strong{\code{annotate()} cannot be used with \code{geom =
  "table"}}. Use \code{geom_table} directly also for adding annotations.
}
\section{Alignment}{
 You can modify table alignment with the \code{vjust} and
  \code{hjust} aesthetics. These can either be a number between 0
  (right/bottom) and 1 (top/left) or a character ("left", "middle", "right",
  "bottom", "center", "top").

This geometry is inspired on answers to two questions in
  Stackoverflow. In contrast to these earlier examples, the current geom
  obeys the grammar of graphics, and attempts to be consistent with the
  behaviour of 'ggplot2' geometries.
