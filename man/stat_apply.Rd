\usage{
stat_apply_group(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, geom = "line",
  .fun.x = NULL, .fun.x.args = list(), .fun.y = NULL,
  .fun.y.args = list(), position = "identity", na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = FALSE, inherit.aes = TRUE, ...)

stat_apply_panel(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, geom = "line",
  .fun.x = NULL, .fun.x.args = list(), .fun.y = NULL,
  .fun.y.args = list(), position = "identity", na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = FALSE, inherit.aes = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}}. Only needs to be set at the layer level if you
are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
the plot defaults.}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use display the data}

\item{.fun.x, .fun.y}{function to be applied or the name of the function to be
applied as a character string. One and only one of these parameters should
be passed a non-null argument.}

\item{.fun.x.args, .fun.y.args}{additional arguments to be passed to the
function as a named list.}

\item{position}{The position adjustment to use for overlapping points on this
layer}

\item{na.rm}{a logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped
before the computation proceeds.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE}
never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather
than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that
define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the
default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2]{borders}}.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}}. This
can include aesthetics whose values you want to set, not map. See
\code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}} for more details.}
}
\description{
\code{stat_apply_group} and \code{stat_apply_panel} apply functions to data.
In most cases one should simply use transformations through scales or summary
functions through \code{stat_summary()}. There are some computations that are
not scale transformations but are not usual summaries either, the number of
data values does not decrease. It is always possible to precompute quantities
like cummulative sums or running medians, and normalizations it can be
convenient to apply such functions on-the-fly to ensure that grouping is
consistent between computations and aesthetics. One particularity of these
statistics is that they can apply simulateneously different functions to
\code{x} values and to \code{y} values when needed. In contrast
\code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_smooth}} applies a function that takes both
\code{x} and \code{y} values as arguments.
}
\details{
The function to be applied is expected to be vectorized and to
  return a vector of the same length. The vector mapped to the x or y
  aesthetic is passed as the first positional argument to the call. The
  function must accept as first argument a vector or list that matches the
  data.
}
\note{
This stat is at early stages of development and its interface may
  change at any time, or it may be even removed from the package without
  previous notice.

\section{Computed variables}{
 One x or y of is replaced by the vector returned
  by the applied function. \describe{ \item{x}{x-value as returned by
  \code{.fun.x}} \item{y}{y-value as returned by \code{.fun.y}} }
}

\examples{

set.seed(123456)
df <- data.frame(X = rep(1:20,2),
                 Y = runif(40),
                 category = rep(c("A","B"), each = 20))
ggplot(df, aes(x = X, y = Y, colour = category)) +
  stat_apply_group(.fun.y = cumsum)
ggplot(df, aes(x = X, y = Y, colour = category)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_apply_group(.fun.y = runmed, .fun.y.args = list(k = 5))
ggplot(df, aes(x = X, y = Y, colour = category)) +
  stat_apply_panel(.fun.y = function(x) {(x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))})
