\title{Plot residuals from fit as segments.}
\usage{
stat_fit_deviations(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, geom = "segment",
  method = "lm", formula = NULL, position = "identity", na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = FALSE, inherit.aes = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}} or \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes_string}}. Only needs
to be set at the layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
the plot defaults.}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use display the data}

\item{method}{character Currently only "lm" is implemented.}

\item{formula}{a "formula" object.}

\item{position}{The position adjustment to use for overlapping points on this
layer}

\item{na.rm}{a logical indicating whether NA values should be stripped
before the computation proceeds.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE}
never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather
than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that
define both data and aesthetics and should not inherit behaviour from the
default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2]{borders}}.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}}. This
can include aesthetics whose values you want to set, not map. See
\code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}} for more details.}

\description{
\code{stat_fit_deviations} fits a linear model and returns fitted values and
residuals ready to be plotted as segments.
}
\details{
This stat can be used to automatically show residuals as segments
in a plot of a fitted model equation. At the moment it supports only linear
models fitted with function \code{lm()}. This stat only generates the
residuals, the predicted values need to be separately added to the plot,
so to make sure that the same model formula is used in all steps it is best
to save the formula as an object and supply this object as argument to the
different statistics.
}
\note{
For linear models \code{x1} is equal to \code{x2}.
}
\section{Computed variables}{
 Data frame with same \code{nrow} as \code{data}
  as subset for each group containing five numeric variables. \describe{
  \item{x1}{x coordinates of observations} \item{x2}{x coordinates of fitted
  values} \item{y1}{y coordinates of observations} \item{y2}{y coordinates of
  fitted values}}
}
\examples{
library(ggplot2)
# generate artificial data
set.seed(4321)
x <- 1:100
y <- (x + x^2 + x^3) + rnorm(length(x), mean = 0, sd = mean(x^3) / 4)
my.data <- data.frame(x, y, group = c("A", "B"), y2 = y * c(0.5,2))
# give a name to a formula
my.formula <- y ~ poly(x, 3, raw = TRUE)
# plot
ggplot(my.data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = my.formula) +
  stat_fit_deviations(formula = my.formula, color = "red") +
  geom_point()
